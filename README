* Introduction

The contents of most web services are formatted in ill-structured HTML,
makes it extremely difficult to incorporate other site's services into
your own. Even if such hand-coded attempts are made, the lack of
streamlined representation forbids you from integrating other service's
contents, or re-formats them into the same style.

Take searching as an example: currently, most meta-search packages limits
you to a fixed array of popular general-purpose Search Engines, and are
incapable of take advantage of each one's unique services. The same
limitation also applies to price-comparison services, special-purpose
monitor sites (e.g. financial "stock watcher"), etc.

OurNet::Query delivers a totally customizable engine to automatically
monitor any web service's contents, and "wrap" them into any format -
XML, RSS, database, or HTML templates - without any hard coding. Totally
transparent to the end-user, they will feel as if these results are
offered by the same source, hence makes it very easy to build a site
filled with richly news, services and related contents.
